# Everyday NASA
Instagram automation that takes images from NASA API every day and uploads them to instagram. None of these pictures are owned by me.. Everything is owned by NASA API.

Right now the usage of this library (as probably others too) may harm your Instagramâ€™s profile because of new script-detection algorithms.

# Installation

Version of `Instabot==0.104.0` is required.

```py
$ git clone https://github.com/daniel-slosar/EverydayNASA.git

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
